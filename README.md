# Hero-SwiftUI-example
A simple three ViewController example which shows that [Hero](https://github.com/HeroTransitions/Hero) works when using Swift UI

## Contents

This repository contains a basic proof of concept which shows that Hero can work when (most of the) UI is built using SwiftUI.

The project has two hero enabled viewcontrollers with one or more images. One UIKit based ViewController and one SwiftUI based viewcontroller, both ViewControllers transition to the same UKit based destination viewController when being tapped. Tapping the destination ViewController dismisses it.
